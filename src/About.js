              Hello there! My name is William Cui <br></br>
              and I am currently enrolled in a B.Sc in Mathematics <br></br>
              at the University of British Columbia with an expected<br></br>
              graduation of May 2022. I am  currently searching for <br></br>
              software engineering internships!<br></br>
            
              <br></br>
            
              I have experience in full-stack application development <br></br>
              and I am currently exploring other avenues of computer science, <br></br>
              such as machine learning, data science, and quantitative analysis.<br></br>

              <br></br>
              In my spare time, I enjoy making music, working out, and gaming.<br></br>
              I can also speak three languages: English, French, and Chinese!<br></br>
              I am passionate about art, design, and creativity, so I try to<br></br>
              incorporate them in my software development. <br></br>
